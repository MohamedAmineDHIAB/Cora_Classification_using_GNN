# Cora_Classification_using_GNN


In this REPO we try to use Pytorch Geometric to build a Graph Neural Network and test it on the Cora Citation Dataset.

## Cora :

The Cora dataset consists of 2708 scientific publications classified into one of seven classes. The citation network consists of 5429 links. Each publication in the dataset is described by a 0/1-valued word vector indicating the absence/presence of the corresponding word from the dictionary. The dictionary consists of 1433 unique words.
